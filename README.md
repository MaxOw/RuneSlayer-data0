This repo contains data (imgs, fonts) used in [RuneSlayer][runeslayer-github].
Since the files here are made up from an amalgamation of different open licenses
(see [Credits.dhall][credits] for exact attribution/license index) that could
potentially be in conflict with RuneSlayers license I decided to discharge my
obligations under these licenses by putting all these files in a separate repo
and making the user download it by themselves specifically. If you are an
author/copyright holder of any of the works contained here and consider this
solution a breach of your rights, please let me know and I'll try to rectify
that.
